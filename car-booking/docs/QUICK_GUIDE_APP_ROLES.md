Create these 4 roles:

#### Role 1: Administrator

‚úÖ Enable this app role
```

#### Role 2: HR Staff
```

‚úÖ Enable this app role
```

#### Role 3: Manager

Allowed member types: Users/Groups
‚úÖ Enable this app role
```

#### Role 4: Employee
```
Display name: Employee
Value: Employee
Description: Booking creation access
Allowed member types: Users/Groups
‚úÖ Enable this app role
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Assign Roles to Users

#### Go to Enterprise Applications:
1. **Azure AD** ‚Üí **Enterprise applications**
2. Find: **Carbooking-SGS**
3. Click: **Users and groups**

#### Add Role Assignment:
1. Click: **+ Add user/group**
2. **Users**: Select user(s)
3. **Select a role**: Choose role (Admin/HR/Manager/Employee)
4. Click: **Assign**

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the Roles

1. **Logout** from the car booking app
2. **Login** again with OAuth
3. Check browser console (F12):
   ```
   App roles from token: ["Admin"]
   Role determined from app roles
   User assigned role: Admin
   ```

## üéØ Benefits Over Groups

‚úÖ **Faster** - No extra API calls needed  
‚úÖ **Secure** - Roles are app-specific  
‚úÖ **Simple** - Easy to manage in Azure  
‚úÖ **Efficient** - Smaller token size  

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Roles not showing?
- User needs to logout and login again
- Check role assignment in Enterprise Applications
- Verify app role is enabled

### Need to assign to many users?
1. Create groups: `CarBooking-Admins`, `CarBooking-HR`, etc.
2. Assign app role to the GROUP
3. Add users to the group

## üìù Current Implementation

The app now supports BOTH methods:
1. **App Roles** (preferred) - Checked first
2. **Groups** (fallback) - Used if no app roles

Once you set up app roles, they'll be used automatically!
