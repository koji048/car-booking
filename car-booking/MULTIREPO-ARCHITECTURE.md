# 🏗️ Monorepo to Multi-Repository Migration Architecture

## Executive Summary
Transitioning from a Turborepo monorepo to a multi-repository architecture for the Car Booking System to enable independent deployment, team autonomy, and granular access control.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Monorepo Structure
```
car-booking/ (Single Repository)
├── apps/
│   ├── web/       → Next.js Web App (Port 3001)
│   ├── server/    → Next.js API Server (Port 3005)
│   └── native/    → React Native Mobile App
└── packages/
    ├── ui/        → Shared UI Components
    ├── types/     → TypeScript Type Definitions
    └── utils/     → Shared Utilities
```

### Dependency Analysis
- **web** depends on: @car-booking/types, @car-booking/ui, @car-booking/utils
- **server** depends on: @car-booking/types, @car-booking/utils
- **native** depends on: (currently separate, minimal shared deps)
- Cross-cutting: tRPC contract between web ↔ server

## Proposed Multi-Repository Architecture

### Repository Structure
```
GitHub Organization: car-booking-system/
│
├── 📦 car-booking-web/              (Public/Private)
│   └── Next.js Web Application
│
├── 📦 car-booking-api/              (Private)
│   └── API Server with tRPC
│
├── 📦 car-booking-mobile/           (Private)
│   └── React Native Application
│
├── 📦 car-booking-ui/               (Private Package)
│   └── Shared UI Component Library
│
├── 📦 car-booking-types/            (Private Package)

```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Prepare for Split (Week 1)
1. **Decouple Hard Dependencies**
   - Extract environment configs
   - Separate build processes
   - Remove Turborepo-specific configs

2. **Establish Package Registry**
   - Set up private npm registry (GitHub Packages/Artifactory)
   - Configure package publishing pipelines
   - Version all packages (start at 1.0.0)

### Phase 2: Extract Shared Packages (Week 2)
```bash
# Order of extraction (dependencies first)
1. car-booking-types    → Publish as @car-booking/types@1.0.0
2. car-booking-utils    → Publish as @car-booking/utils@1.0.0
3. car-booking-ui       → Publish as @car-booking/ui@1.0.0
```

### Phase 3: Split Applications (Week 3)
```bash
# Extract each application
1. car-booking-api      → Independent deployment
2. car-booking-web      → Consumes API via tRPC
3. car-booking-mobile   → Optional migration
```

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & DevOps (Week 4)
- Separate CI/CD pipelines per repository
- Independent deployment strategies
- Cross-repo testing strategies

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Package Management Strategy

#### NPM Registry Configuration
```json
// .npmrc for private packages
@car-booking:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
//npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

#### Package Versioning
```json
// car-booking-web/package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@car-booking/types": "^1.0.0",
    "@car-booking/ui": "^1.0.0",
    "@car-booking/utils": "^1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### 2. API Contract Management

#### tRPC Router Sharing
```typescript
// car-booking-types/src/trpc.ts
export type AppRouter = {
  // Shared router type definitions
}

// car-booking-api/src/routers/index.ts
import type { AppRouter } from '@car-booking/types';

// car-booking-web/src/utils/trpc.ts
import type { AppRouter } from '@car-booking/types';
```

### 3. Development Workflow

#### Local Development with npm link
```bash
# For local cross-repo development
cd car-booking-types && npm link
cd car-booking-web && npm link @car-booking/types
```

#### Git Submodules Alternative
```bash
# If keeping local development coupled
git submodule add git@github.com:org/car-booking-types.git packages/types
```

## Repository-Specific Configurations

### car-booking-web Repository
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy Web
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - run: npm run deploy
```

### car-booking-api Repository
```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy API
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    environment: production
    steps:
      - Database migrations
      - Deploy to cloud provider
```

### Shared Package Repository
```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Package
on:
  release:
    types: [created]
jobs:
  publish:
    steps:
      - run: npm publish
```

## Benefits & Trade-offs

### ✅ Benefits
- **Independent Deployments**: Each service deploys separately
- **Team Autonomy**: Teams own their repositories
- **Granular Permissions**: Repository-level access control
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different tech stacks possible
- **Cleaner Git History**: Focused commits per repository
- **Faster CI/CD**: Smaller codebases build faster

### ⚠️ Trade-offs
- **Dependency Management**: Version synchronization complexity
- **Cross-repo Changes**: Coordinated PRs needed
- **Local Development**: More complex setup
- **Code Duplication**: Potential for duplicated logic
- **Integration Testing**: Requires explicit contracts
- **Operational Overhead**: More repos to maintain

## Migration Checklist

### Pre-Migration
- [ ] Backup current monorepo
- [ ] Document all inter-package dependencies
- [ ] Set up package registry
- [ ] Create GitHub organization
- [ ] Define team permissions

### During Migration
- [ ] Extract and publish types package
- [ ] Extract and publish utils package
- [ ] Extract and publish UI package
- [ ] Split API server repository
- [ ] Split web application repository
- [ ] Split mobile application repository
- [ ] Set up CI/CD for each repository

### Post-Migration
- [ ] Verify all builds pass
- [ ] Test deployment pipelines
- [ ] Update documentation
- [ ] Archive monorepo (keep for reference)
- [ ] Monitor for 2 weeks
- [ ] Team training on new workflow

## Rollback Strategy
If migration fails:
1. Keep monorepo operational until fully migrated
2. Run both architectures in parallel during transition
3. Maintain git history in archived monorepo
4. Document lessons learned

## Success Metrics
- Deploy frequency per service
- Build time reduction
- Team velocity
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Independent scaling achieved

## Next Steps
1. Review with engineering team
2. Choose package registry solution
3. Create detailed timeline
4. Begin Phase 1 preparation
